  			     NOTHING ELSE MATTERS
			      (HETFIELD/ULRICH)
			       METALLICA  1991
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SO CLOSE NO MATTER HOW FAR
  COULDN'T BE MUCH MORE FROM THE HEART
  FOREVER TRUSTING WHO WE ARE
  AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS

  NEVER OPENED MYSELF THIS WAY
  LIFE IS OURS, WE LIVE IT OUR WAY
  ALL THESE WORDS I DON'T JUST SAY
  AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS

  TRUST I SEEK AND I FIND IN YOU
  EVERY DAY FOR US SOMTHING NEW
  OPEN MIND FOR A DIFFRENT VIEW
  AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS

      NEVER CARED FOR WHAT THEY DO
      NEVER CARED FOR WHAT THEY KNOW
      BUT I KNOW

  SO CLOSE NO MATTER HOW FAR
  COULDN'T BE MUCH MORE FROM THE HEART
  FOREVER TRUSTING WHO WE ARE
  AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS
   
      NEVER CARED FOR WHAT THEY DO
      NEVER CARED FOR WHAT THEY KNOW
      BUT I KNOW

  NEVER OPENED MY SELF THIS WAY
  LIFE IS OURS, WE LIVE IT OUR WAY
  ALL THESE WORDS I DON'T JUST SAY
  AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS

  TRUST I SEEK AND I FIND IN YOU
  EVERY DAY FOR US SOMTHING NEW
  OPEN MIND FOR A DIFFRENT VIEW
  AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS  

      NEVER CARED FOR WHAT THEY SAY
      NEVER CARED FOR GAMES THEY PLAY
      NEVER CARED FOR WHAT THEY DO
      NEVER CARED FOR WHAT THEY KNOW
      BUT I KNOW

  SO CLOSE NO MATTER HOW FAR
  COULDN'T BE MUCH MORE FROM THE HEART
  FOREVER TRUSTING WHO WE ARE
  NO NOTHING ELSE MATTERS...

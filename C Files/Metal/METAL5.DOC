			    DON'T TREAD ON ME
			    (HETFIELD/ULRICH)
			     METALLICA 1991
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIBERTY OR DEATH, WHAT WE SO PROUDLY HAIL
ONCE YOU PROVOKE HER, RATTLING OF HER TAIL
NEVER BEGINS IT, NEVER, BUT ONCE ENGAGED...
NEVER SURRENDERS, SHOWING THE FANGS OF RAGE

DON'T TREAD ON ME

      SO BE IT
      THREATEN NO MORE
      TO SECURE PEACE IS TO PREPARE FOR WAR
      SO BE IT
      SETTLE THE SCORE
      TOUCH ME AGAIN FOR THE WORDS THAT YOU'LL HEAR EVERMORE...

DON'T TREAD ON ME

LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT, SHE WITH THE DEADLY BITE
QUICK IS THE BLUE TONGUE, FORKED AS THE LIGHTNING STRIKE
SHINNING WITH BRIGHTNEES, ALWAYS ON SURVEILLANCE
THE EYES, THEY NEVER CLOSE, EMBLEM OF VIGILANCE

DON'T TREAD ON ME

      SO BE IT
      THREATEN NO MORE
      TO SECURE PEACE IS TO PREPARE FOR WAR
      SO BE IT
      SETTLE THE SCORE
      TOUCH ME AGAIN FOR THE WORDS THAT YOU'LL HEAR EVERMORE...

DON'T TREAD ON ME

      SO BE IT
      THREATEN NO MORE
      TO SECURE PEACE IS TO PREPARE FOR WAR

LIBERTY OR DEATH, WHAT WE SO PROUDLY HAIL
ONCE YOU PROVOKE HER, RATTLING OF HER TAIL

      SO BE IT
      THREATEN NO MORE
      TO SECURE PEACE IS TO PREPARE FOR WAR
      SO BE IT
      SETTLE THE SCORE
      TOUCH ME AGAIN FOR THE WORDS THAT YOU'LL HEAR EVERMORE...

DON'T TREAD ON ME...

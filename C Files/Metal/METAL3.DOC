			  HOLIER THAN THOU
			  (HETFIELD/ULRICH)
			   METALLICA 1991

NO MORE !
THE CRAP ROLLS OUT YOUR MOUTH AGAIN
HAVEN'T CHANGED, YOUR BRAIN IS STILL GELATIN
LITTLE WHISPERS CIRCLE AROUND YOUR HEAD
WHY DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT YOURSELF INSTEAD

WHO ARE YOU? WHERE YA BEEN? WHERE YA FROM?
GOSSIP IS BURNING ON THE TIP OF YOUR TONGUE
YOU LIE SO MUCH YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF
JUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUGED YOURSELF

     HOLIER THAN THOU
     YOU ARE
     HOLIER THAN THOU
     YOU ARE

     YOU KNOW NOT

BEFORE YOU JUDGE ME TAKE A LOOK AT YOU
CAN'T YOU FIND SOMETHING BETTER TO DO
POINT THE FINGER, SLOW TO UNDERSTAND
ARROGANCE AND IGNORANCE GO HAND IN HAND

IT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE IT'S WHO YOU KNOW
OTHERS LIVES ARE THE BASIS OF YOUR OWN
BURN YOUR BRIDGES BUILD THEM BACK WITH WEALTH
JUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUGED YOURSELF

     HOLIER THAN THOU
     YOU ARE
     HOLIER THAN THOU
     YOU ARE

     YOU KNOW NOT...

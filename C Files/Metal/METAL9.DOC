			     OF WOLF AND MAN

OFF THROUGH THE NEW DAY'S MIST I RUN
OUT FROM THE NEW DAY'S MIST I HAVE COME

I HUNT

THEREFORE I AM
HARVEST THE LAND
TAKING OF THE FALLEN LAMB

OFF THROUGH THE NEW DAY'S MIST I RUN
OUT FROM THE NEW DAY'S MIST I HAVE COME

WE SHIFT

PLUSING WITH THE EARTH
COMPANY WE KEEP
ROAMING THE LAND WHILE YOU SLEEP

    SHAPE SHIFT     NOSE TO THE WIND
    SHAPE SHIFT     FEELING I'VE BEEN
    MOVE SWIFT      ALL SENSES CLEAN
    EARTH'S GIFT    BACK TO THE MEANING OF LIFE

BRIGHT IS THE MOON HIGH IN STARLIGHT
CHILL IN THE AIR COLD AS STEEL TONIGHT
WE SHIFT
CALL OF THE WILD
FEAR IN YOUR EYES
IT'S LATER THAN YOU REALIZED

    SHAPE SHIFT     NOSE TO THE WIND
    SHAPE SHIFT     FEELING I'VE BEEN
    MOVE SWIFT      ALL SENSES CLEAN
    EARTH'S GIFT    BACK TO THE MEANING OF LIFE

I FEEL A CHANGE
BACK TO A BETTER DAY
HAIR STANDS ON THE BACK OF MY NECK
IN WILDNEES IS THE PRESERVATION OF THE WORLD

SO SEEK THE WOLF IN THYSELF

    SHAPE SHIFT     NOSE TO THE WIND
    SHAPE SHIFT     FEELING I'VE BEEN
    MOVE SWIFT      ALL SENSES CLEAN
    EARTH'S GIFT
    BACK TO THE MEANING OF WOLF AND MAN...

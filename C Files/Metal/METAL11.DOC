			     MY FRIEND OF MISERY

			       METALLICA 1991
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
YOU JUST STOOD THERE SCREAMING
FEARING NO ONE WAS LISTENING TO YOU
THEY SAY THE EMPTY CAN PATTLES THE MOST
THE SOUND OF YOUR OWN VOICE MUST SCOTHE YOU
HEARING ONLY WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR
AND KNOWING ONLY WHAT YOU'VE HEARD
YOU    YOU'RE SMOTHERED TRAGEDY
YOU'RE OUT TO SAVE THE WORLD

    MISERY
    YOU INSIST THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD
    SHOULD BE ON YOUR SHOULDERS
    MISERY
    THERE'S MUCH MORE TO LIFE THAN WHAT YOU SEE
    MY FRIEND OF MISERY

YOU STILL STOOD THERE SCREAMING
NO ONE CARING ABOUT THESE WORDS YOU TELL
MY FRIEND BEFORE YOUR VOICE IS GONE
ONE MAN'S FUN IS ANOTHER'S HELL
THESE TIMES ARE SENT TO TRY MEN'S SOULS
BUT SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ALL YOU SEE
YOU    YOU'LL TAKE IT ON ALL YOURSELF
REMEMBER, MISERY LOVES COMPANY

    MISERY
    YOU INSIST THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD
    SHOULD BE ON YOUR SHOULDERS
    MISERY
    THERE'S MUCH MORE TO LIFE THAN WHAT YOU SEE
    MY FRIEND OF MISERY

YOU JUST STOOD THERE CREAMING
MY FRIEND OF MISERY...

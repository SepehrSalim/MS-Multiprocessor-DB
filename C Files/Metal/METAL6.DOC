			     THROUGH THE NEVER
			 (HETFIELD/ULRICH/HAMMETT)
			       METALLICA 1991
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALL THAT IS, WAS AND WILL BE
UNIVERSE MUCH TOO BIG TO SEE
TIME AND SPACE NEVER ENDING
DISTURBING THOUGHTS, QUESTIONS PENDING
LIMITATION OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING
TOO QUICK TO CRITICIZE
OBLIGATION TO SURVIVE
WE HUNGER TO BE ALIVE

	 ALL THAT IS, EVER
	 EVER WAS
	 WILL BE EVER
	 TWISTING
	 TURNING
	 THROUGH THE NEVER

IN THE DARK, SEE PAST OUR EYES
PURSUIT OF TRUTH NO MATTER WHERE IT LIES
GAZING UP TO THE BREEZE OF THE HEAVENS
ON A QUEST, MEANING, PERSON
CAME TO BE, HOW IT BEGUN
ALL ALONE IN THE FAMILY OF THE SUN
CURIOSITY TEASING EVERYONE
ON OUR HOME, THIRD STONE FROM THE SUN

	 ALL THAT IS, EVER
	 EVER WAS
	 WILL BE EVER
	 TWISTING
	 TURNING
	 THROUGH THE NEVER

ON THROUGH THE NEVER
WE MUST GO
ON THROUGH THE NEVER
OUT TO THE
EDGE OF FOREVER
WE MUST GO
ON THROUGH THE NEVER
THEN NEVER COMES

	 ALL THAT IS, EVER
	 EVER WAS
	 WILL BE EVER
	 WHO WE ARE
	 ASK FOREVER
	 TWISTING
	 TURNING
	 THROUGH THE NEVER
	 NEVER...

			       THE GOD THAT FAILED
				(HETFIELD/ULRICH)
				 METALLICA 1991
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRIDE YOU TOOK
PRIDE YOU FEEL
PRIDE THAT YOU FELT WHEN YOU'D KNEEL

NOT THE WORD
NOT THE LOVE
NOT WHAT YOU THOUGHT FROM ABOVE

    IT FEEDS
    IT GROWS
    IT CLOUDS ALL THAT YOU WILL KNOW
    DECEIT
    DECEIVE
    DECIDE JUST WHAT YOU BELIEVE

      I SEE FAITH IN YOUR EYES
      NEVER YOU HEAR THE DISCOURAGING LIES
      I HEAR FAITH IN YOUR CRIES
      BROKEN IN THE PROMISE, BETRAYAL
      THE HEALING HAND HELD BACK BY THE DEEPENED NAIL

      FOLLOW THE GOD THAT FAILED

FIND YOUR PEACE
FIND YOUR SAY
FIND THE SMOOTH ROAD ON YOUR WAY

TRUST YOU GAVE
A CHILD TO SAVE
LEFT YOU COLD AND HIM IN GRAVE

    IT FEEDS
    IT GROWS
    IT CLOUDS ALL THAT YOU WILL KNOW
    DECEIT
    DECEIVE
    DECIDE JUST WHAT YOU BELIEVE

      I SEE FAITH IN YOUR EYES
      NEVER YOU HEAR THE DISCOURAGING LIES
      I HEAR FAITH IN YOUR CRIES
      BROKEN IN THE PROMISE, BETRAYAL
      THE HEALING HAND HELD BACK BY THE DEEPENED NAIL

      FOLLOW THE GOD THAT FAILED

      I SEE FAITH IN YOUR EYES
      BROKEN IN THE PROMISE, BETRAYAL
      THE HEALING HAND HELD BACK BY THE DEEPENED NAIL

      FOLLOW THE GOD THAT FAILED

PRIDE YOU TOOK
PRIDE YOU FEEL
PRIDE THAT YOU FELT WHEN YOU'D KNEEL

TRUST YOU GAVE
A CHILD TO SAVE
LEFT YOU COLD AND HIM IN GRAVE

      I SEE FAITH IN YOUR EYES
      NEVER YOU HEAR THE DISCOURAGING LIES
      I HEAR FAITH IN YOUR CRIES
      BROKEN IN THE PROMISE, BETRAYAL
      THE HEALING HAND HELD BACK BY THE DEEPENED NAIL

      FOLLOW THE GOD THAT FAILED...

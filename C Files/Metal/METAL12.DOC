			   THE STRUGGLE WITHIN
			    (HETFIELD/ULRICH)
			      METALLICA 1991
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
REACHING OUT FOR SOMETHING YOU'VE GOT TO FEEL
WHILE CLUTCHING TO WHAT YOU HAD THOUGHT WAS REAL

KICKING AT A DEAD HORSE PLEASES YOU
NO WAY OF SHOWING YOUR GRATITUDE
SO MANY THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO DO
WHAT IS IT ? WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE

WHAT THE HELL
WHAT IS IT YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA FIND ?
HYPOCRITE
BOREDOM SETS INTO THE BORING MINO

    STRUGGLE WITHIN   IT SUITS YOU FINE
    STRUGGLE WITHIN   YOUR RUIN
    STRUGGLE WITHIN   YOU SEAL YOUR OWN COFFIN
    STRUGGLE WITHIN   THE STRUGGLING WHITHIN

HOME IS NOT A HOME IT BECOMES A HELL
TURNING IT INTO YOUR PRISON CELL
ADVANTAGES ARE TAKEN, NOT HANDED OUT
WHILE YOU STRUGGLE INSIDE YOUR HELL

REACHING OUT
GRABBING FOR SOMETHING YOU'VE GOT TO FEEL
CLOSING IN
THE PRESSURE UPON YOU IS SO UNREAL

    STRUGGLE WITHIN   IT SUITS YOU FINE
    STRUGGLE WITHIN   YOUR RUIN
    STRUGGLE WITHIN   YOU SEAL YOUR OWN COFFIN
    STRUGGLE WITHIN   THE STRUGGLING WHITHIN

REACHING OUT FOR SOMETHING YOU'VE GOT TO FEEL
WHILE CLUTCHING TO WHAT YOU HAD THOUGHT WAS REAL

WHAT THE HELL
WHAT IS IT YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA FIND ?
HYPOCRITE
BOREDOM SETS INTO THE BORING MINO

    STRUGGLE WITHIN   IT SUITS YOU FINE
    STRUGGLE WITHIN   YOUR RUIN
    STRUGGLE WITHIN   YOU SEAL YOUR OWN COFFIN
    STRUGGLE WITHIN   THE STRUGGLING WHITHIN...

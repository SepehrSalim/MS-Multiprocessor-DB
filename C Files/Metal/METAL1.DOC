SAY YOUR PRAYERS LITTLE ONE
DON'T FORGET, MY SON
TO INCLUDE EVERYONE

TUCK YOU IN, WARM WITHIN
KEEP YOU FREE FROM SIN
TILL THE SANDMAN HE COMES

     SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN
     GRIPPING YOUR PILLOW TIGHT

       EXIT: LIGHT
       ENTER: NIGHT
       TAKE MY HAND
       WE'RE OFF TO NEVER NEVER LAND

SOMETHING'S WRONG, SHUT THE LIGHT
HEAVY THOUGHTS TONIGHT
AND THEY AREN'T OF SNOW WHITE

DREAMS OF WAR, DREAMS OF LIARS
DREAMS OF DRAGON'S FIRE
AND OF THINGS THAT WILL BITE

       EXIT: LIGHT
       ENTER: NIGHT
       TAKE MY HAND
       WE'RE OFF TO NEVER NEVER LAND

NOW I LAY ME DOWN TO SLEEP
PRAY THE LORD MY SOUL TO KEEP
IF I DIE BEFORE I WAKE
PRAY THE LORD MY SOUL TO TAKE

HUSH LITTLE BABY, DON'T SAY A WORD
AND NEVER MIND THAT NOISE YOU HEARD
IT'S JUST THE BEASTS UNDER YOUR BED
IN YOUR CLOSET, IN YOUR HEAD

       EXIT: LIGHT
       ENTER: NIGHT
       GRAIN OF SAND

       EXIT: LIGHT
       ENTER: NIGHT
       TAKE MY HAND
       WE'RE OFF TO NEVER NEVER LAND...

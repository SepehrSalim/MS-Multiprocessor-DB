				WHEREVER I MAY ROAM
				 (HETFIELD/ULRICH)
				   METALLICA 1991
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-AND THE ROAD BECOMES MY BRIDE
 I HAVE STRIPPED OF ALL BUT PRIDE
 SO IN HER I DO CONFIDE
 AND SHE KEEPS ME SATISFIED
 GIVES ME ALL I NEED

-AND WITH DUST IN THROAT I CRAVE
 ONLY KNOWLEDGE WILL I SAVE
 ROVER   WANDERER
 NOMAD   VAGABOND
 CALL ME WHAT YOU WILL

   BUT I'LL TAKE MY TIME ANYWHERE
   FREE TO SPEAK MY MIND ANYWHERE
   AND I'LL REDEFINE ANYWHERE
   ANYWHERE I ROAM
   WHERE I LAY MY HEAD IS HOME

-AND THE EARTH BECOMES MY THRONE
 I ADAPT TO THE UNKNOWN
 UNDER WANDERING STARS I'VE GROWN
 BY MYSELF BUT NOT ALONE
 I ASK NO ONE

-AND MY TIES ARE SEVERED CLEAN
 THE LESS I HAVE THE MORE I GAIN
 OFF THE BEATEN PATH I REIGN
 ROVER   WANDERER
 NOMAD   VAGABOND
 CALL ME WHAT YOU WILL

   BUT I'LL TAKE MY TIME ANYWHERE
   I'M FREE TO SPEAK MY MIND ANYWHERE
   AND I'LL REDEFINE ANYWHERE
   ANYWHERE I ROAM
   WHERE I LAY MY HEAD IS HOME

   BUT I'LL TAKE MY TIME ANYWHERE
   FREE TO SPEAK MY MIND ANYWHERE
   AND I'LL REDEFINE ANYWHERE
   ANYWHERE I ROAM
   WHERE I LAY MY HEAD IS HOME

   CARVED UPON MY STONE
   MY BODY LIE, BUT STILL I ROAM

	WHEREVER I MAY ROAM...

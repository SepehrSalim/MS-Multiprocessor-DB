			    THE UNFORGIVEN
		       (HETFIELD/ULRICH/HAMMETT)
			    METALLICA 1991
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW BLOOD JOINS THIS EARTH
AND QUICKLY HE'S SUBDUED
THROUGH CONSTANT PAINED DISGRACE
THE YOUNG BOY LEARNS THEIR RULES

WHIT TIME THE CHILD DRAWS IN
THIS WHIPPING BOY DONE WRONG
DEPRIVED OF ALL HIS THOUGHTS
THE YOUNG MAN STRUGGLES ON AND ON HE'S KNOWN
A VOW UNTO HIS OWN
THAT NEVER FROM THIS DAY
HIS WILL THEY'LL TAKE AWAY

    WHAT I'VE FELT
    WHAT I'VE KNOWN
    NEVER SHINED THROUGH IN WHAT I'VE SHOWN
    NEVER BE
    NEVER SEE
    WON'T SEE WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

    WHAT I'VE FELT
    WHAT I'VE KNOWN
    NEVER SHINED THROUGH IN WHAT I'VE SHOWN
    NEVER FREE
    NEVER ME
    SO I DUB THEE UNFORGIVEN

THEY DEDICATE THEIR LIVES
TO RUNNING ALL OF HIS
HE TRIES TO PLEASE THEM ALL
THIS BITTER MAN HE IS
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE THE SAME
HE'S BATTLED CONSTANTLY
THIS FIGHT ME CANNOT WIN
A TIRED MAN THEY SEE NO LONGER CARES
THE OLD MAN THEN PREPARES
TO DIE REGRETFULLY
THAT OLD MAN HERE IS ME

    WHAT I'VE FELT
    WHAT I'VE KNOWN
    NEVER SHINED THROUGH IN WHAT I'VE SHOWN
    NEVER BE
    NEVER SEE
    WON'T SEE WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

    WHAT I'VE FELT
    WHAT I'VE KNOWN
    NEVER SHINED THROUGH IN WHAT I'VE SHOWN
    NEVER FREE
    NEVER ME
    SO I DUB THEE UNFORGIVEN

YOU LABELED ME
I'LL LABEL YOU
SO I DUB THEE UNFORGIVEN...

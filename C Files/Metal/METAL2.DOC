      I'M YOUR DREAM, MAKE YOUR REAL
      I'M YOUR EYES      WHEN YOU MUST STEAL
      I'M YOUR PAIN      WHEN YOU CAN'T FEEL
      SAD BUT TRUE

      I'M YOUR DREAM, MIND ASTRAY
      I'M YOUR EYES      WHILE YOU'RE AWAY
      I'M YOUR PAIN      WHILE YOU REPAY
      YOU KNOW IT'S SAD BUT TRUE

YOU

YOU'RE MY COVER, MY SHELTER

      SAD BUT TRUE

      I'M YOUR DREAM, MIND ASTRAY
      I'M YOUR EYES      WHILE YOU'RE AWAY
      I'M YOUR PAIN      WHILE YOU REPAY
      YOU KNOW IT'S SAD BUT TRUE

HATE
I'M YOUR HATE
I'M YOUR HATE WHEN YOU WANT LOVE
PAY
PAY THE PRICE
PAY FOR NOTHING'S FAIR

HEY

HEY
